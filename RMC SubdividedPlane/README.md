Example for the usage of the Runtime Mesh Component for Unreal Engine 4
===================================
** I decided to put this example on GitHub after I struggled some time to wrap my head around the RMC plugin.
* This example contains a simple provider to create a subdivided plane mesh, modified at runtime. It shows how multiple providers and modifers are chained.
* The example contains an interface to BP.
Down below you can see how the providers and modifiers are organized.
